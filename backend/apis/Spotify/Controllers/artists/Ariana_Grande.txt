Ariana Grande-Butera ( AR-ee-AH-nə GRAHN-day byuu-TAIR-ə; born June 26, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Regarded as a pop icon, she is an influential figure in popular music and is known for her four-octave vocal range which extends into the whistle register.
Grande began her career as a teenage actress by appearing in the Broadway musical 13 (2008), and rose to fame as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013) and its spin-off series Sam & Cat (2013–2014). She signed with Republic Records and released her retro-pop and R&B-influenced debut studio album, Yours Truly (2013), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Grande blended pop, R&B, and electronic on her second and third albums, My Everything (2014) and Dangerous Woman (2016), solidifying her critical and commercial success. Both albums contained the internationally successful singles "Problem", "Break Free", "Bang Bang", "One Last Time", "Into You" and "Side to Side".
Themes of personal struggles influenced Grande's trap-infused albums Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019). The former won Grande her first Grammy award, while the latter garnered US number-one singles "Thank U, Next" and "7 Rings", and made her the first solo artist to occupy the top three spots of the Billboard Hot 100. She subsequently achieved the most number-one debuts in Hot 100 chart history with the title track of her sixth album, Positions (2020), as well as the collaborations "Stuck with U" with Justin Bieber and "Rain on Me" with Lady Gaga. After a musical hiatus, Grande released her critically acclaimed seventh album, Eternal Sunshine (2024), which became her sixth US number-one album and spawned the US number-one singles "Yes, And?" and "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)". She returned to film acting with the political satire Don't Look Up (2021) and received widespread praise for her portrayal of Glinda in the 2024 film adaptation of the fantasy musical Wicked. The latter earned Grande a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
Among the world's best-selling music artists, Grande has sold over 90 million records worldwide and is the fifth-highest-certified digital singles female artist. Her various accolades include two Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, two Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, ten MTV Video Music Awards, and thirty-seven Guinness World Records. Grande was named the Top Female Artist of the Year twice (2017 and 2019), the Woman of the Year (2018), the most successful female artist to emerge in the 2010s, and the ninth-greatest pop star of the 21st century by Billboard. She is featured in listicles such as Rolling Stone's greatest singers of all time, Time 100 (2016 and 2019), Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019–2020), and was ranked the highest-paid female musician of 2020 by Forbes. Outside of music and film, Grande has worked with many charitable organizations and advocates for animal rights, mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality. Her business ventures include R.E.M. Beauty, a cosmetics brand launched in 2021, and a fragrance line that has earned over $1 billion in global retail sales. She has a large social media following, being the sixth-most-followed individual on Instagram.
