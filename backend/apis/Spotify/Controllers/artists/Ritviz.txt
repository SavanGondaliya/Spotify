Rizvi or Rizavi (Arabic/Urdu: رضوی) is the Urdu variant of the Arabic surname Ridhawi (or Radhawi) and the Persian surname Razavi. It is a Muslim surname commonly associated with the branch of Husaynids, who claim descent from the Imam Ali al-Ridha, a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his grandsons, Husayn ibn Ali (patrilinealy, through his great great-grandfather Ali Zayn al-Abidin, who was the son of Husayn) and Hasan ibn Ali (through his great great-grandmother, Fatima bint Hasan, who was the daughter of Hasan). Their lineage also traces back to Muhammad and Abd ar-Rahman, the sons the prominent companion of the Islamic prophet, and the first Rashidun caliph, through his great-grandmother Umm Farwa. Since the Rizvi clan traces their lineage to Fatimah (the prophet's daughter), many of them often use the prefix Sayyid (or its synonyms) in front of their name.Rizvi or Rizavi (Arabic/Urdu: رضوی) is the Urdu variant of the Arabic surname Ridhawi (or Radhawi) and the Persian surname Razavi.
